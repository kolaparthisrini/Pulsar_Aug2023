Apache Pulsar--MQ 
=================
Day1-3-Aug-2023
----------------
>https://github.com/kolaparthisrini/Pulsar_Aug2023
>MQ

>Web server and App server
Web Server:3 components
===========
Example: Tomcat,nginx,jetty....etc
Note: apache is not a web server.http engine
It is a combination of catalina,jasper,http engine and middleware services.
catalina---this is a container for running servlets.
Jasper---this is a container for running jsp.
http engine--->responsible for understanding and processing http requests.
middleware services----->Additional services provided by servers.min of 6 services and max will be below 11.
Exg: tx management,lifecycle mgmt,connection pooling....etc

APP Server:6 components
===========
Example: Glassfish,Weblogic,Jboss,Pramathi....etc

catalina---this is a container for running servlets.
Jasper---this is a container for running jsp.
http engine--->responsible for understanding and processing http requests.
EJB/enterprise java bean container---->responsible for running EJB beans
MQ/messaging Container---->responsible for running messaging services.
middleware services----->Additional services provided by servers.min of 8 services and max will be below 18.
Exg: tx management,lifecycle mgmt,connection pooling....etc

>>>CORBA---->EJB---->Spring---->Springboot----->?
---------------------------------------->

Data sources:
-----------------
Web sources: Fb/Twitter/youtube/....etc.
Hardware sources: camera/Sensors/smart watches....etc

destinations point:is location where we are going to persist data.
Example: Cloud,Database like mysql/mongodb/maria db,Hadoop...etc
we are dealing with data which is in petabytes.

Source---->MQ--->Destination
1layer--->2nd--->3rd  layer

>>In mq-messaging queue terminology===>Source is called as Producer,destination is called as Consumer.
MQ is a Queue datatructure/memory which will persist your data temporarly while data in transit.

Example: Tata Sky,videoiocon disk...etc

Tatasky-----producer
srinivas--->consumer
Dish/Antena--->Queue

Note: MQ is not database.But any data which is available in queue can be persisted using persistant queue.Other wise use non persistant queue.

I can  save data that was coming to Queue into database like mongodb/dynamodb..etc or AWS S3 Glacier.

>>
Lux soap/Mysore sandle,Santoor soap----integrients
RIN Soap--integrients

we need to have a specification which shld be followed by  vendors/companies.
if a soap has X component--then i can say that can be used for Personal use
if a soap has Y component--then i can say that can be used for washing clothes.
>>Specification consists of set of rules/best practices and regulations to following while designing or implementing any product.
====>Any product based company which wants to create MQ tool,thn they need to follow JMS Specification.
IBM--->IBM Mq tool
AWS---->AWS SNS/SQS service
RabbitMQ
Active MQ
Apache kafka
Apache Pulsar....etc
jakarta messaging APi spec

https://javaee.github.io/jms-spec/

==========>
https=>=http+TLS===>App layer
TLS===> SSL certificates---->
used for secure data transmission across network

>A certificate consists of some security keys mainly used for protecting data taht travels across n/w.
We need to purchase these certificates from vendors like Godaddy,versign,CA certs,paypal....etc
https://www.sslshopper.com/

Every certificate will have expiry time.Wen it expires,we need to renew.These certificates shld be placed in Servers.

>certs will be maintained by DEVOPS engineers or  IT team in your organization.

DEV server,Pre-prod server,Prod server.Certifcates are of  2types.
1)Self signed---used for testing purpose only.---not secure
2)Commercial certificates.---recommended---highly secured

tcp===>Transport layer

=>Streaming:continous flow of data from source to dstination.

Srinivas---->his flight is at 11:25-boarding is done--flight about to start.Srinivas kept his mobile in airplane mode.
At 11:28am,srinivas mother is trying to send msg.
What will happen to message?

Ans)till that time where you msg sits?
in this case,it will be in queue but not in db.It used Dead-letter Queue.

Queue are of 3 types in MQS.
1)FIFO Queue
2)Dead Letter Queue
3)Negitive acknowledgement Queue

S---------------------MQ server--------------------------

Pulsar

In mq servers,we are have rerty mechanism,if no of retrys are more than 3,then that message is elibile for pushing to dead letter Queue.

No of retrys can be customizable.

Dead letter queue creation shld be done by developer or admin.

if destination receives msg successuly,it will receive acknowledgement.

>> Encryption and decryption:

encryption makes your data unreadable format,so that hackers cannt understand and modify data in middle.

encryption and decryption is classified into 2 types.
Symmetric and Assymetric
>Symmetric means using same key for both encryptiona nd decryption.
>Assymetric means using different keys for both encryptiona nd decryption.
================================
Encryption and encoding?wht is the difference?
encryption---uses keys for encryption and decryption the msg
encoding---use algorithms for encoding and decoding.
Encoding is weak,so hacker can crack it easily.
============================================================================

Apache Pulsar
-------------------
>Apache version in training will be 3.x but no 2.x.
s/w requirements:
jdk17
Google chrome
Linux/Mac o/s
text editor is available its enough
Eclipse Nenon/Spring STS any version
Mysql db or mongo db

H/w:
8Gb ram
>atleast 8gb of hard disk

Note: Pulsar is now available for windows.

>>Pulsar can be installed in below ways.
1)Using Docker--->recommended for Dev/pre-production  environments-->docker-compose feature is teh recommended.
2)On Bare metal-->on laptop single node machine--->recommended for Training Purpose
3)On AWS/Azure/GCP/IBM cloud----->recommended for production  environments
4)On Kubernetes or openshift----->recommended for production  environments
5)On cloud Instances like Ec2---->for testing/dev server

======>IF you are ahving multiple sources and peta bytes of data transmitting from one point to another then use Pulsar/Kafka.

For limited data ,use RabbitMQ/Active MQ servers.

But pulsar is 2.5 times faster than kafka and provides good throughput and low latency.
>When it comes to documentation part,kafka is best.pulsar documentation ans support from pulsar team is less.
>pulsar had come up with connectors.

db connectors/kafka connector/server connectors like netty.
>
We had installed Apache pulsar standalone on bare metal.
Now i will show the same on AWS EC2 linux.
------------------------------------------------
Pulsar

we are getting huge data from sensors--datasource or origin point---MQ--->push the data to database

Asssume consumer crashed because of technical problem or natural calamity?the how do u deal with it?
sol)MQ server

Srinivas Laptop(India)------------------------>Harisith Laptop(US)

Sceanario 1:

Srinivas want to push database table data to Harisith laptop.
srinivas can design a Springboot+hibernate  and then thru that app he can push data tpo harisith laptopwhat if Harisith Laptop is crashed?
in this case if srinivas tries to push data to Harisith Laptop,data will fail.
sol)Use MQ Servers as a mediators,which will have queues for storing your data temporarly till sonsumer is back.


Apache Pulsar Architceture:
===============================

>To work on pulsar,we need to have a cluster.

A cluster is group of machines/nodes/terminals/Brokers.
cluster are of 2 types.
consumer is also called as subscriber.
1)Single node cluster (training and testing):a cluster with one node.
2)Multi node cluster(production and dev environments)
a cluster with 'n' no of  nodes.
>Every broker has atleast one topic.Topic is aslso called as QUEUE.We can have as many topics based on broker config or available memory.
>Consumers shld have info about topic name and broker name.
This mechanism is called Queue architecture.
In Queue architecture,we will have one producer and one consumer. thsis is 1-1 mechanism

>Pub-subscriber or pub/sub architecture/models:
publishers will push message and broadcast the message,so that multiple consumers can receive the data.

Problems if broker crashes:
1)data is lost.
2)consumer will be waiting.That means you are unnecessarily wasting resources.

11:30am
11:45 amazon app is not working.Availability of data will be 24/7.

if i say replication factor=23. we need to have 3 brokers.
6,brokers shld be 6
When we want to go with replication,replication factor is very important.Architects will descide this replica factor based on past experience and business.
>
For sensitive data or enterprize app,we go with AZ(available zones )replication.

Asia-------Business----broker1
Africa---south africa---broker2
America------north ameriza----Virgina---broker3
Europe
Antartica

above approach will increase infra cost.
>broker means a server.Evry server will have metadata.
serverid,Ip address,cluster ipaddress,portno,topicname,status of broker(ON/OFF)

Node management shld happen.

assume there are 3 brokers.
broker1,broker2,broker3
Note: cluster is mandetory for node management.
For node management,pulsar uses Apache Zookeeper tool.Zookeper will maintain metadata about the nodes in cluster and its state.if any machine fails ,it gives signal(1/0) to pulsar saying this is down.

>Zookeper(bully algo) will take the help of Pulsar and identifies one broker/node as master and remining as slaves.Otherwise,admin can identity one node as Master from Admin GUI screen.
>Apache Zookeeper uses Election algorithm to elect master.zookeeper is a seperate server.

Note: zookeeper will maintaing cluster metadata.

3 lakhs nodes,then 1 zookeper cannot perform node management.Architect shld do proper calculation for 
maintianing zookeeper servers.
>>Topic are of 2 types.

persistant and non persistant
>>in non persistant queue,if consumer fails to consume data or if there is no ack,then msg will be deleted.
>Every msg which we send from producer shld not exceed 5mb.

In big data,if i get 25mb of data,then what will happen?
ans)in this case, data will be splitted into chunks/data packets.

Where do messages stored in Pulsar?
ans)it shld be in queue,but in pulsar it is different.It stores in different layer for which we use bookkeeper.
>Data will be persisted in bookkeeper.
>Generally in pulsar topic,we will have keys and values only.

Bookkeeepr is a server where data is stored in the form of ledgers.ledger is again a log file.

Topic--->Boookeeper----->ledgers---->fragments----->Entries-key and value

Finally entry is a location where your mesages are stored.

>In cloud,entire US is splitted into zones.Zones like US EAST,US WESt,US-EAST2
>Datacenters or servers are pyhsically maintained at that location.

case2: Asume server is in mumbai with out replication?
if sunami hits mumbai,what will happen to seerver. 


Abc is a company having business in Singapore,India and Hongkong.Now tell me wheter will u maintain servers?
ans)india,hongkong and singapore

every country will have IT security policy and DAta security laws.

Srini i can i  have replicate data in afganistan?
ans) no customers in afganistan
2)always check countrys data security laws.if it is not strong,dont store data there.
3)If server is ina coubtry where natural calamilities occues more frequently,then dont go with that zone.

best solution is cloud.

=====================================
Day 2-Aug 4th
=============
Topic--->Ledger--->Fragment--->entry
>Proxy works at security layer.
>proxy is responsible for making your brokers visible to outside world.
>Everybody cannot access broker directly.Only authorized users will have access to brokers.Only admin can grant permissions.

>>>>>>>>>>>>Security--Authentication
1)Http Authentication-----low security
2)JSON web tokens/Oauth1.0/Oauth2.0 auth---tight security
3)Kerberos
4)SAML Authentication---recommended if you want tight security.better than JSON tokens.Cost of infra is very high.

>Zookeeper performs node management and maintains cluster metadata.

>>>>>>Note: if we work on single node cluster,no need of zookeeper.
Producer p1 is a new channel company,which publishes news across India and US.

p1 is pushing message in XML format.But consumer knows only JSON.--Then there isa challenge for accepting and publishing messages to end user.

>>XML---heavy weight .Consumers can access news through mobile app,Desktop web,tablets or kiosk machine.

If producer sends huge xml data to consumer,can a mobile can undertsnad that huge xml data.?
Ans)No.Mobile cannot understand huge xml data.Mobile is light weight component.Then we need t transform xml to json format.JSON is light weight than xml.Now a days we can use BSON.

xml--->JSON--->BSON

--->Pulsar says both parties shld agree to common schema.APache pulsar schema format.
Avro or protobuf---commonly used schema formats.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
We can write code for interacting with pulsar using client libraries.
Officially maintained Pulsar Clients for Java, Go, Python, C++, Node.js, and C#.

=======>Rules to remember while subscribing for Topic====
1)In pulsar,when we want to consume the message,make sure proper subscription model is selected.
If not pulsar will not work as per expectations.
2)Pulsar had come up with subscription model.Any subscriber shlb follow the subscribtion model rules.
3)when we work on pulsar client libraries like java/python,make sure we are clear about subscription model,Otherwise code will fail.

>>Topic compaction:
---------------------
>old messages which were not acknowledged will be removed from topics;if we perform topic compaction,otherwise memory shortage might arise in topic.
>only admin can perform these operations.
>time constraint shld identified by either customer or architect based on past experiance or best practices.

>>In pulsar,we do have another topic called as "negitive ack queue".
>>In this queue,we have messages which were not acknowledge from consumer.
>>only admin can create this type of negitive ack queues on brokers.

======>For MQ servers,below are the Job roles:
Cloud/on-premises:
MQ Developer---coding as per business requirements
MQ Admin--certification is mandetorys
MQ Report analyst----pulsar basics,reporting and power-bi/Qlikview tools

>Apache pulsar bookkeeper uses a database internally.name of the database is "Rockdb".It is like mongodb.
--------->
In apache pulsar,the server configuration files are vailable under "conf" folder.

brokerServicePort=6650
webServicePort=8080

bind address = 0.0.0.0 that means it is called as loop back address or local machine
>by default TLS is disabled.For tls we use 8443 port no.

Quetion: I want to push a message to a topic named as "Srini",But topic is not available in cluster.
What will happen?
ans)pulsar will chck allowAutoTopicCreation is set to true or false.IF topic is not available and allowAutoTopicCreation is false then it will throw error msg.

or
IF topic is not available and allowAutoTopicCreation is true then it will create new topic.

Note: In realtime,we will diable autosubscription feature,for better security.

=============>
Sceanario 3:
Srinivas, had topic with name "A" and "B".A topic is used most frequently and B is not used from last 4  months.

what we need to do?
do we need to keep that topic like that or delete it or make it inactive.
2nd: I want to delete all inactive topics,because i am not going to use infuture also,then what i need to do?

if brokerDeleteInactiveTopicsEnabled=true then all inactive topics will be autodeleted by pulsar.

>>>>>>When broker knows wen to remove inactive topics?
ans)brokerDeleteInactiveTopicsFrequencySeconds=600000

>>>Where to place SSL certifcate in Apache pulsar?
ans)"tlsCertificateFilePath"

tlsCertificateFilePath="D:\Materials\pulsar\apache-pulsar-3.0.0-bin\apache-pulsar-3.0.0\conf"

---------------------------------------------->
>>In pulsar ,if we want to represent a specific topic programatically,then we need to follow below syntax:
{type}://{tenant}/{namespace}/{topic}
persistent://public/default/a-new-topic

type means public or private,persitent,non-persistent
namespace: it is like package in java.In pulsar,namespace are used to group topics.
tenat: single/Multi-tenant

In cloud,memory is costly.We shld utilize the memory carefully.
In cloud memory cost will be based on mainly 1 parameter.
1)if we want entire memory to be allocated to one user then cost willl be very high.----independent house
2)if we want entire memory to be allocated to more than one  user then cost willl be low.---Apartment

Single tenant means it is like independdent house with land
Multi-tenant means it is like apartment.

Note: By default Apache pulsar is multi-tenant.Always topics shld be under a namespace.

>>we are going to design simple java programs.
=====================>
>>RESTful services in Apache pulsar:
========================================
>if we want to access pulsar cluster,we can access even through RESTful services.
>In rest we will have Endpoints.

If we want to fetch any info or any operation on cluster,we can do it using below ways:
1)using admin commands---done
2)Using java/python code
3)Thru Admin console--GUI---not done,because this feature is available only for kubernetes.
4)using restful services---done

https://pulsar.apache.org/admin-rest-api/?version=3.0.0#operation/BrokerStats_getTopics2

Note: If ssl certificate is not configured at broker side,then https protocl will not work for restful services.
===============

Interacting with Apache Pulsar using Java Client Library:
=============================================================
https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/3.0.x/client-libraries-java/

>Usining java libraries we can create producer,consumer,topics and admin tasks using java code.
>
1)create pulsar client obj;
PulsarClient pulsarClient = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl(pulsarBrokerRootUrl).build();
2)Create a producer object using pulsarclient reference.
Producer<byte[]> producer = pulsarClient.newProducer();
3)Configure topic information in producer.
topic(topic)
   .messageRoutingMode(MessageRoutingMode.SinglePartition)
4)send the message to apache pulsar using producer obj.
send()

https://pulsar.apache.org/api/client/3.0.x/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/Message.html

Consumer: pulsar had came up with Consumer class for creating consumer object.
==========
 Consumer consumer1 = client.newConsumer()
        .topic("my-topic")
        .subscriptionName("my-subscription")
        .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Failover)
        .subscribe()

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.pulsar</groupId>
  <artifactId>pulsar-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>

 PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder()
                              .serviceUrl("pulsar://56.67.88.9:6650,pulsar://56.67.88.9:6651")
                              .build();

while (true) {

  Message msg = consumer.receive();

  try {
     
      System.out.println("Message received: " + new String(msg.getData()));
     consumer.acknowledge(msg);
  } catch (Exception e) {
      
      consumer.negativeAcknowledge(msg);
  }
}

Assume there is a microservices with name "A" and "Service with name "B".
Now A service wants to communicxate with B service.In theis case,we can use MQ pulsar.
One service can act as producer and another service can act as consumer.

One microservice can communicate with another using below ways:
1)Using MQ servers---recommended
2)REST API
3)RPC calls
4)gRPC calls
5)Socket programming
>When we deal with composite microservices,then above ways are mandetory.

composite microservices: group of services is called as composite.In composite one service output is input to another service.

Example: Google maps


Springboot support for MQ servers:
---------------------------------------
>>Springboot support is not provided by default.
>>from 2022,few developers created api for Spring boot Apache Pulsar.
===>
>"PulsarTemplate" for quickly publishing to Pulsar topics using one-liner send methods.
>Provide a "PulsarListener" annotation to write high-level Pulsar consumers.
>"MessageListenerContainer" infrastructure to support PulsarListener.
>Both record and "batch-based PulsarListener" consumption.

i recommend u to use java client libraries for the same.

Pulsar Connectors:
=======================
>>>pulsar had given plug n play connectors.
A connector is a ready made components which is used for transfering data from Source to desitination usinh apache pulsar as a mediator.

Exampl 1: there is a folder d:/ with 3000 files which are in srinivas system.He wants to transfer that file in secure manner to Yash laptop.

As soon i place my file in d drive it shld start transfering without manual invilvement.

Note: we will see similar types of connectors in Mulesoft/Apache camel and SAP.

Note: To test connectors,we need to have docker installed in your system.
